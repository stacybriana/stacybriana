We are currently both studying at UCF and plan to graduate in December of 2019. I am pursuing my masters of education in curriculum and instruction with a curriculum leadership track. I want to expand my knowledge about curriculum and strengthen my own educational philosophy so I can one day start a charter school. The focus of the school will be on self-directed learning. I want to empower students to take ownership of their education and become lifelong learners.
